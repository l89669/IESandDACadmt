The Core WinForms ADMT classes were added. 
Some Data classes were moved to ViewModel (e.g. DbSpController) and will need to have their data split out into a new ViewModel class to adhere to structure. 
Refactoring of namespace changes will be required. 
Then WPF classes will be needed to replace all WinForms. 
Static data can be used in static pages, but Binding to data classes will be needed for V to VM mapping. 
Then UI Update mechanism will need to be refactored for full MVVM compliance.
